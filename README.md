# Take Note App
*Google Keep clone called Take Note where users can input a note to display on a bulletin board. Currently, I've built out the front-end but plan on adding a back-end to store notes*
- Front-end: React
- Back-end: IN-PROGRESS - will be Node/Express
- Database: IN-PROGRESS - will be Mongo DB
- Deployed with Vercel [here](https://take-note-app.vercel.app/)

**What I enjoyed while building this app:**
I really enjoy working with React. I find components to be an intuitive way of organizing and building out a website. I also really liek React beacuse I feel like it allows developers clear ways to see the implementation of core computer science principals while clearly connecting those to styling an app through JSX (if that makes any sense!). 

**What I struggled with while building this app:**
It took me a LOT of debugging and meticulous thinking (and lots of reading React documentation and Stack Overflow) to correctly build component trees where the child must feed info in order to trigger an event in the parent. It really helped when I slowed down and pseudocoded what I wanted to happen (e.g., what information needed to be passed back in order to add a new note to the existing array of notes so that the page displays all notes rather than only the current one). 

**Things I learned through building this app:**
I still *really* like React. I feel like not only does it's design makes sense to me, but it really pushes me to think through the core base of code principles -- recursive functions, data structures, basic algorithms, etc -- which has helped me connect a lot of things from CS classes with practical application in ways I find quite fulfilling.
